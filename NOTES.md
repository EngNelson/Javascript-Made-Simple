# What is Programing?

- It's giving instructions to a computer.
  And the computer follows our instructions.

# JAVASCRIPT

- It's the only language that can run in a browser.

# Syntax

- Like grammar

# Exercises 1

1. We learned alert('hello'); to create a popup with the text "hello".
   Now create a popup with your name in it.
2. Display today's date in the Console in Chrome.

function body.

1.) Creating a function = defining a function

- Model View Controller
- It's way to structure our code.

# MODEL

- Contains all the code that saves and manages data.

# VIEW

- Contains all the code that manages visuals.
  Renders visuals using data in the model.

# CONTROLLER

- Connects Model and View together:

1. Responds to events from the view(e.g button clicks)
2. Tells the model to update its data(and the view to re-render)
